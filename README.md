> track ai usage while you code, compete by consistency not brains

## what is this?

cribble tracks your ai tool usage across chatgpt, claude, github copilot, and 40+ other tools. install the browser extension, code normally, and see where you rank among developers worldwide.

**the idea:** consistency beats intelligence. use ai tools regularly, build better habits, climb the leaderboard.

## how it works

1. **browser extension** - passively tracks your visits to ai tools
2. **web dashboard** - view your stats and global rankings  
3. **leaderboard** - compete with developers worldwide
4. **privacy-first** - no code analysis, just usage patterns

## features

- 🏆 global developer leaderboard
- 📊 personal usage analytics  
- 🎮 gamified ai usage tracking
- 🔒 privacy-focused (no code access)
- ⚡ real-time updates

## development

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# start dev server
npm run dev

# set up environment
cp .env.example .env.local
# add your supabase credentials
```

## tech stack

- **frontend:** next.js 14, tailwind css, typescript
